class PricingTierCondition(UniversalBaseModel):
    """
    Condition for matching a pricing tier based on usage details. Used to implement tiered pricing models where costs vary based on usage thresholds.

    How it works:
    1. The regex pattern matches against usage detail keys (e.g., "input_tokens", "input_cached")
    2. Values of all matching keys are summed together
    3. The sum is compared against the threshold value using the specified operator
    4. All conditions in a tier must be met (AND logic) for the tier to match

    Common use cases:
    - Threshold-based pricing: Match when accumulated usage exceeds a certain amount
    - Usage-type-specific pricing: Different rates for cached vs non-cached tokens, or input vs output
    - Volume-based pricing: Different rates based on total request or token count

    Regex pattern to match against usage detail keys. All matching keys' values are summed for threshold comparison.
    
    Examples:
    - "^input" matches "input", "input_tokens", "input_cached", etc.
    - "^(input|prompt)" matches both "input_tokens" and "prompt_tokens"
    - "_cache$" matches "input_cache", "output_cache", etc.
    
    The pattern is case-insensitive by default. If no keys match, the sum is treated as zero.

    """
    Comparison operator to apply between the summed value and the threshold.
    
    - gt: greater than (sum > threshold)
    - gte: greater than or equal (sum >= threshold)
    - lt: less than (sum < threshold)
    - lte: less than or equal (sum <= threshold)
